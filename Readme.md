# Competitions-Service

This project follows a microservices architecture, with each service handling a specific business domain and implemented in python.

## Features

- Flash sales and sneaker drops
- Distributed microservices in Node.js, Python, Go, PHP, JavaScript, and Ruby
- Multiple database technologies (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, DynamoDB, MySQL, InfluxDB)
- Communication via REST, gRPC, WebSocket, Webhook, SOAP, and GraphQL
- Automated deployment with Docker, GitHub Actions, and Terraform on AWS

## Project Structure
